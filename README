These scripts can be used to install and deploy glusterfs in a cluster.
It installs the specified version of glusterfs in all the nodes of the
cluster parallelly and reports back the result.
It can be used to create and start a volume in big cluster. Specifications
abou the volume can be set in configfile


Here is a list of each script and what it accomplishes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. run_helper.py

It can be used to run any command in the all the nodes.It assumes that the
passwordless ssh is set between host machine and remote machines. This
script also has the general functions for getting server ip, client ip etc.
This script can take 4 options which is listed below.

'-r' or '--run'  --> run command in the server machines
'-R' or '--Run'  --> same as '-r' but runs in all machines which includes
                     server and clients.
'-c' or '--copy' --> copy file to all the server machines. source path in
                     host and destination in server machines are separated
                     by a ':'
'-C' or '--Copy' --> same as '-c' but copies to all machines which includes
                     both servers and clients.

For example:
./run_helper.py -r 'ifconfig'
Above command runs ifconfig in all server machines and displayes the result
in host machine

./run_helper.py -R 'ifconfig'
This runs above command in both servers and clients and display the result.

./run_helper.py -c /home/source_file:/root/destination_file
Above command copies /home/source_file to all /root/destination_file in all
the servers. Note that the source and destination is separated by ':'.
